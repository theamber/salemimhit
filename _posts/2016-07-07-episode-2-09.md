Amber and Tony discuss the end of [POI](http://imdb.com/title/tt1839578). There is also a reference to the [Bones episode that hurt](http://www.themarysue.com/malware-uploaded-from-bone-bones/) and how trapped in VR will haunt our nightmares. [Hanna](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993842/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2) was awesome though.
