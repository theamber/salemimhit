## The Change Up

We were excited to bring in new episodes, but a job change and really unfortunate schedule conflicts have dashed those hopes. There are a few episodes that were left on the shelf and those should be up soon. 

I'm not sure about whether I'll continue the show solo or change up the format a bit, but I'm not just chucking it in the bin.
